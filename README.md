# WebDev-Website-Template-and-code
Please note that this repository contains the code as a template for an html javascript and css education site. 

All of the following files in the repository are currently all on the necessary ones for proper functionality. 

If you want features like changing the admin password and adding users it would be a good idea to release it the internet using apache2 php and mariadb or mysql. 

Happy coding.
